Steps for Data Quality Management (DQM) following the DAMA framework:

1 Data Quality Management Framework Overview:
Data Management Framework provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring data quality across all data-related processes, including governance, quality, and life cycle management. The goal is to continuously monitor and improve data quality by focusing on:

Data Governance: Policies, processes, and responsibilities.

Data Quality: Ensuring data is accurate, complete, and consistent.

Data Life Cycle Management: Managing data through its creation, storage, and use.

2. The DQ Lifecycle
This lifecycle focuses on improving data from the moment it is captured until it is archived or destroyed. The steps typically involved are:

Data Profiling: Assessing the data to understand its quality.

Data Cleansing: Correcting or removing inaccurate, corrupted, or incomplete data.

Data Enrichment: Adding missing data or improving data quality by sourcing additional data.

Data Validation: Ensuring data adheres to specified rules and standards.

Data Monitoring: Ongoing tracking of data quality metrics.

Data Governance and Stewardship: Implementing policies and assigning responsibility for managing the data.

Step 1: Data Profiling
The first thing we need to do is analyze the existing customer_data to identify any issues with data quality such as missing values, incorrect formats, inconsistencies, and duplicates.

We will:

Assess data completeness (e.g., are there any null values?).

Assess data consistency (e.g., are email formats correct? Are dates valid?).

Assess data accuracy (e.g., do the Account_Balance and Join_Date match the expected formats?).

Step 2: Data Cleansing
After profiling, we'll clean the data based on the results:

Handle Missing Data: For missing values, you can either fill them with appropriate default values (e.g., "Unknown" for missing names or emails) or drop the rows if necessary.

Correct Formatting: Ensure that email addresses, phone numbers, and dates are in the correct format.

Remove Duplicates: If there are duplicates (e.g., two records for the same customer), we will remove them.

Fix Invalid Data: If any data points like Account_Balance or Join_Date are invalid (e.g., negative balances or future join dates), we will either correct or remove these entries.


Step 3: Data Enrichment
Enrichment can be achieved by sourcing additional data that can improve your customers dataset. For example:

Add missing customer details from a third-party data source (like addresses or social media profiles).

Add geographical information based on date_of_birth or Phone data (e.g., location based on phone area codes).


Step 4: Data Validation
Ensure that data meets certain validation rules:

Customer ID: Should be unique for each customer.

Email: Should match the format of a valid email address.

Phone: Should be a valid phone number format.

Account Balance: Should be a positive value (no negative account balances).

Date of Birth: Should be in a reasonable range (i.e., customers must be at least 18 years old).


Step 5: Data Monitoring
After implementing the above processes, you need to monitor your data regularly to ensure quality is maintained. This involves setting up automated data quality checks to run on a periodic basis.

Step 6: Data Governance
Establish a data governance framework to assign responsibilities for data stewardship. Implement data access controls, define roles and responsibilities, and create data quality standards and policies that ensure your data remains accurate and trustworthy.
